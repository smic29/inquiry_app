# Inquiry-app

A simple Ruby on Rails project for Avion School to show basic CRUD functionalities in rails.

## Initial Commit
- Added CRUD operations via Scaffold.
- TODO:
  - [x] Implement Bootstrap for styling
  - [ ] Explore more on what I can do in terms of MVC
  - [x] Make pages more presentable
  - [ ] Encountered an error when creating a new Inquiry. Numbers > 100000000000000 are out-of-range. Need to fix
  - [ ] Make sure that in `_form.html.erb`, the select type option is disabled and shown by default
  - [x] Next Button added in `show.html.erb`
  - [ ] Order the index by timestamp, so the most recent ones are showed first and maybe add a new column of status.
